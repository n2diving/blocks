The blocks gem is many things.

It acts as:

* a container for reusable blocks of code and options
* a common interface for rendering code, whether code defined previously in Ruby blocks, Rails partials, or proxies to other blocks of code
* a series of hooks and wrappers that can be utilized to render code before, after, and around other blocks of code, as well as before each, after each, and around each item in a collection
* a templating utility for easily building reusable, customizable UI components
* a means for DRYing up oft-repeated code in your layouts and views
* a simple mechanism for changing or skipping the rendering behavior for particular blocks of code
